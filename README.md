# Distributed Microservice Framework for CoreOS

This is an example (modular) framework for building distributed [microservice](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html)
applications.

Example implementations of this framework are present on the following branches:
* `helloworld`
    * this branch implements a distributed "Hello World" style application - see its [README](https://github.com/carlpulley/coreos-example-application/blob/helloworld/README.md) for more information.
* `lift`
    * this branch implements (most) of the [Lift](https://github.com/eigengo/lift) application by Jan Machacek - see its [README](https://github.com/carlpulley/coreos-example-application/blob/lift/README.md) for more information.
